- set usable by several user on multi-user machine

* 05/15/2016

- Use R3.3.0
- Add DMR annotation
- Add option to select DMR detection with qvalue or pvalue (pvalue is DSS stantard use)

* 04/03/2016
- Add DSS to workflow
- Add graphics per feature
- Add real bed file output
- Remove eDMR  (as it was removed from CRAN)

Debug when extract several context in methylation calling component

--> Equivalent to revision 29 of jflow-toolshed (http://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/projects/jflow-toolshed/)* 
	- add dmr detection
	- add parameters : 
		--annotation : annotation file (gff ot gtf files), used in DMC categorization
		--tss : file with TSS positions (files format: chr    tss    strand), used to plot methylation level around TSS
		--quality : Quality threshold to trim low-quality ends 
		--phred64 : Quality scores phred64 scale used
		--no-overlap : The overlapping paired reads will be ignored during extraction step
		--test stranded : By default reads covering both strands of a CpG dinucleotide are merged, set stranded option to not merge
		--dmr : Set this option to compute DMR
		--num-c : cutoff of the number of CpGs (CHH or CHG) in each region to call DMR [default=3]
		--num-dmc : cutoff of the number DMCs in each region to call DMR [default=1]
		--feature : features to plot ',' (e.g.  exon, intron, 5_prime_utr...)
	- improve r scripts to categorize DMC and generate graphics
	- add script to use to install required R package before launching a pipeline
	- remove calling to read.bismark of methylKit and use directly perl script methCall.pf of methylkit to avoid generation of sam files.
	- remove snp in R script instead of using a python component
